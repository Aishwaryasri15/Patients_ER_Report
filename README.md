***Emergency Room Visit Report***

This Power BI dashboard provides insights into patient emergency room (ER) visit data, potentially from a hospital or clinic information system. It offers a quick view of patient demographics, wait times, and satisfaction scores.

***Insights***

1. **Overall Patient Flow**

* **High Volume:** There were a significant number of patient visits (9,216) during the analyzed timeframe. 
* **Weekday vs. Weekend:** Weekdays see a higher patient influx compared to weekends. This suggests potential staffing adjustments based on anticipated demand.

2. **Wait Times and Satisfaction**

* **Wait Time Concerns:** The average wait time of 35.36 minutes might be an area for improvement, especially considering a large portion (75.1%) of patients didn't rate the service. 
* **Low Satisfaction Score:** The average satisfaction score of 5.47 suggests there's room to enhance the patient experience in the ER. The high percentage of non-rated responses might also indicate a need for better feedback mechanisms.

3. **Patient Demographics**

* **Age Distribution:** Adults make up the largest group of ER visitors, followed by potentially younger and older age groups (details depend on your bar chart). 
* **Gender Distribution:** Females have a slightly higher percentage of ER visits compared to males.

4. **Temporal Trends**

* **Seasonal Variations:** August 2020 had the most patient visits, while February 2020 had the least. Analyzing trends over a longer period can reveal seasonal patterns or long-term changes.
* **Yearly Increase:** There was an increase in total patient visits from 2019 (4,338) to 2020 (4,878).

5. **Referral vs. Walk-In Rates**

* **Walk-In Dominance:** Walk-in patients make up a larger portion (58.59%) compared to those referred by other healthcare providers (44.41%). Analyzing how this split impacts wait times and satisfaction can help optimize ER resource allocation.

6. **Administrative vs. Non-Administrative Appointments**

* **Administrative Appointments:** These appointments, likely involving more paperwork or insurance processing, make up a significant portion (50.04%) of ER visits. Investigating their impact on wait times and satisfaction could be beneficial. 

***Process Implementation***

1. **Data Acquisition**: Collected patient ER visit data from a hospital information system, including demographics, visit details, wait times, and satisfaction scores.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Ensured data consistency by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and correcting errors.

3. **Data Exploration and Transformation**: Explored data through summary statistics and visualizations. Transformed data by splitting date columns and creating new calculated features, like age groups.

4. **Data Analysis with DAX**: Used DAX formulas in Power BI for complex calculations, such as average wait times by department, and grouped analyses by age, race, and other demographics.

5. **Visualization and Dashboard Design**: Created charts and graphs to communicate insights, including bar charts for patient distribution, line charts for trends, and slicers for data filtering by specific criteria.

***Key Features***

1. **Slicers:** The dashboard allows users to filter the data by time of day (AM/PM visits) to gain a more granular view of patient visits.
2. **Bar Charts:** Bar charts effectively illustrate the distribution of patient visits by age group and gender.
3. **Time Slicing:** The dashboard potentially allows for filtering data by other time periods (weeks, months, quarters, years) to explore trends over time.
